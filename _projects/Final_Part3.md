# 1. Number of License Type
 This data visualization shows the number of different License Types, and we can see that about three kinds of licenses occupy most of the whole.

The data of the x-axis is License Type, and the data type is Nominal. The y-axis and the interactive count line are the number of License Type, and the data type is quantitative. In this chart, the original color of the bar is orange, if not checked, the bar will be gray. Although I did not use python to process the raw data, in the chart I aggregated the License Type.

Inside this char, the interactivity I added is an auxiliary line. This line will display the total number of selected License Types, which can help users better analyze the number of specific License Types.
