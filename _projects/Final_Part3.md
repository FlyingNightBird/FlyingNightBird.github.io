The population growth rates in Wyoming is one of the highest. Wyoming also has an unemployment rate below average.
These elements may make the relationship between unemployment and population more clear in Wyoming.

Due to the data visualization, the population growth rate keeps going down in the history.
If we focus on the performance of growth rate in recent years, we can see that the growth rate in WY can only remain the current level or keep going down after 2010.  
But the population growth rate is still positive even through it has shrunk to 0.2%.  
So what happens to the unemployment rate in recent years? 
### The Unemployment Rate in WY

Through there is a peak in 2016, the tend of umemployment rate keeps going down until Covid-19 comes.
The average rate from 2014 to 2020 should be about 4.5%.
It seems that low unemployment can't stop the population growth rate from dropping, but notice that we can't say low unemployment rate doesn't have postive effect on population growth. There is possibility that it has positive effect but not has enough effect. So Let's see the population growth in a more specific way.
